Todo:

1. Create a demo user with transactions and accounts for demo in the Supabase.
2. Demo user can't be delete, it should throw error from server side that demo user can't be deleted, so that the UI can display the toast with the message "Demo user can't be deleted".
3. Filters are not working on the transaction page.
4. Create a clear all / reset filters button.
5. Create unfinished pages.
6. Publish the app to google console by getting a domain name - don't do SEO
7. Pagination and infinite scroll from client and server
